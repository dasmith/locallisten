# Local Listen

A script to find a few popular songs (on [Google Play (All Access)](http://music.google.com)) of the bands that are performing nearby within the next week (found using [JamBase](http://jambase.com))---giving you time to decide if you want to go to the show.

To use this script you need to have:
  
  1. Credentials to login to an "All Access" Google Play subscription
  2. An API key for JamBase, which you can sign up for at
     http://developer.jambase.com/page

This script depends on the following Python libraries:
